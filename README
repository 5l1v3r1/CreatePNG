Python library for creating PNG image data.

A PNG file consists of chunks. With this library custom chunks can be created for testing decoders.

The current createpng.py consists of code to create the smallest PNG file (I think). The PNG specification state that a empty IDAT chunk should also be valid, but most decoders sayeth nay.
